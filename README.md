repository for all my fun data scraping adventures ðŸ˜…
so in this project i started out trying to scrape a simple site with quotes from various authors but i somehow couldnt figure out how to get the right syntax and the resulting csv file always had some inconsitencies in the text. 
Moving on i tried my hand at a more complex website that tracked the level of alcohol consumption by country. after some trial and error i finally found a working solution that acccurately scraped the 180 rows of data from the table on the website into excel in form of a csv file. this was an actual job posting on upwork that i decided to try my hand at and im very pleased with the results :)
